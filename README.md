# PROJECT-X
# ðŸš— EV Charging Demand Forecasting Project

### ðŸ“Œ Objective
Forecast demand at EV charging stations using timestamped usage, temperature, and traffic data. Visualize patterns to support smarter station planning.

---

### ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- **Python** (optional â€“ for preprocessing)
- **Excel** â€“ basic cleaning
- **Tableau** â€“ full data visualization

---

### ðŸ“Š Visuals Created
1. **Line Chart:** EV charging usage over time, by station
2. **Heatmap:** Charging demand by hour & day
3. **Interactive Filters:** Station, temperature, traffic levels

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
- Peak usage: **6â€“9 PM**
- High-traffic areas = high charging activity
- Optimizing charger placement & pricing can reduce queue times

---

### ðŸ§  Strategy Proposed
- Dynamic pricing
- Demand-based scaling
- Maintenance scheduling
- User behavior nudges
